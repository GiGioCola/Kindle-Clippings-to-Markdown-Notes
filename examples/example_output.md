## Highlights

- "Referring to fragmented global conflicts, the author emphasizes the need to bring attention to forgotten or overlooked wars. These conflicts, often outside the spotlight of the Western world, are fueled by economic interests and complex geopolitical dynamics, creating instability and new tension scenarios."

- "The author highlights the importance of dialogue between opposing sides, emphasizing an alternative perspective on conflicts. They argue that forces at play do not necessarily predetermine an inevitable confrontation, but that there are always possibilities for mediation and resolution through a different approach."
